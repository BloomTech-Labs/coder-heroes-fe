# CoderHeroes Web Design Style Guide

This style guide is a collection of pre-designed elements, graphics, and rules that designers or developers must follow to ensure that separate parts of the website are consistent and create a cohesive experience in the end.

The main purpose of having defined elements is to make it easier for developers to reuse those elements.

This Style Guide is a work in progress, it contemplates possible interactions like hovering, clicking and other states for buttons, titles, links, etc. New UI/UX designers joining this project still have work to do, but will find a structured fledgling project.

Developers should not change or adjust styles based on personal preferences or XD files. It is also important if developers encounter a new interaction or an element that is not covered in this Style Guide, they should consult with the UI/UX teams, UI/UX engineers should create elements /or interactions that offers a relevant and meaningful experience to users, conduct Usability Testing and after approved, review the documentation.

## Figma File

CoderHeroes' design and prototyping was built with Figma, a real-time collaboration system that resides in the cloud and streamlines workflows. In our CoderHeroes Design project all team members have visibility into the created design ensuring everyone is always in the know.

## Ant Design

CoderHeroes' React UI library is Ant Design (antd) that contains a set of high quality components for building interactive user interfaces.

## Prototype and Test

After ideation, the UX team built mockups/wireframes and tested them with the users.
In order to keep our file organized UI/UX team displayed flows following this order:
`(We should delete the 2 pages called wireframe on code)`

Center: Home Page and Unauthorized Users Flow. <br>
Top: Login and Register Flows <br>
Right: Family Dashboard and Parents Flow <br>
Bottom: Students Flow <br>
Left: Instructors and Admin Flow <br>
