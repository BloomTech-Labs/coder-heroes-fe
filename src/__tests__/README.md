## Testing your Components

- You will be using [jest]() along side with [React Testing Library]() to test your application.
- Please put all of your tests for your code in this file.
- You should get into the habit of ensuring that you have coverage for your code _before submitting a pull-request_.

### Running your tests

- When writing tests run the command:
  - `cd into` the root of this directory
  - `npm test` to run your test suite
    - _if you're prompted_ select `a` to run tests in watch mode. This will re-run your test suite when you save any file in your application.
  - In your terminal you will see a test runner that looks something like this:

  - When you're not actively writing tests its best to close that terminal window so that you don't keep running tests when your files are saved.

### Coverage

> ðŸ’¡ Code coverage should be a good goal to have and a good starting place. But every application will be different.

- [Kent Dodds put it nicely](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/common-testing-mistakes#mistake-number-2-100-code-coverage). Strive for solid coverage as we strive to hand you over well-tested code in which we have extreme confidence.

- To run a coverage report for your application simply run `npm run coverage`.
- You should see a print out in your console that looks like this:
