// ## Data Visualization

// These components represent a pattern that you can use when working as a part of a `Hybrid Team`. When working with Data Scientists you'll need to ensure that you communicate as often as you possibly can with that team. They will be doing hard work using [`Plotly`](https://plotly.com/) to ensure that the data they're working with is charted out in a visually appealing way, however you'll need to work with them to integrate their work into the app.

// The `RenderDataViz.js` file demonstrates how you can pull in data from an external API, set that data on state, and then pass that data down to a `<Plot />` component. In this case, the URL for the plot component is the only prop that will be needed to send off the API call and subsequently mount the Plot components w/ the appropriate data. **Be sure to handle your errors nicely.**
