# Loading Component

###Â Example Reusable Loading Component

- Here's an example of a basic reusable `LoadingComponent` component that we created. You can reuse it throughout your application:

```jsx
import { LoadingComponent } from '../components/common';

<LoadingComponent message="...loading" />
```

- Note that we are importing our component from `./components/common`. This is the directory where any of your custom reusable components should live.

### Ant Design Loading Spinner
